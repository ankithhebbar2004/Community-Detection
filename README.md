# Community-Detection
Overview
The Centroid-Based Multiple Local Community Detection (C-MLC) framework is an advanced method designed to identify local communities within various types of networks. By leveraging local topological information and focusing on centroid nodes, the framework efficiently detects multiple, overlapping communities with high precision.

Key Features:
Overlapping Community Detection: Accurately identifies nodes belonging to multiple communities.
Centroid-Based Approach: Ensures precise detection and analysis of local communities.
Personalized PageRank & Conductance Optimization: Enhances the quality of detected communities.
Scalable & Efficient: Robust performance across different network structures and densities.
Broad Applicability: Suitable for social network analysis, systems biology, and more.
Applications
Social Network Analysis: Understand social dynamics and community structures.
Biological Networks: Uncover functional modules and biological processes.
Synthetic Datasets: Test and validate community detection methods.
