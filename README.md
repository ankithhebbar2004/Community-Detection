# Community-Detection
Overview
The C-MLC framework is an advanced method for identifying local communities within various networks. It excels at detecting overlapping communities, where nodes can belong to more than one community.

Key Features

Overlapping Community Detection: Accurately identifies nodes that participate in multiple communities.
Centroid-Based Approach: Ensures precise detection and analysis of local communities by focusing on central nodes (centroids).
Personalized PageRank & Conductance Optimization: Optimizes community detection for improved quality.
Scalable & Efficient: Handles various network structures and densities effectively.
Broad Applicability: Useful for social network analysis, biological network analysis, and more.
Applications

Social Network Analysis: Gain insights into social dynamics and how communities form within a network.
Biological Networks: Uncover functional modules and biological processes by analyzing communities within biological networks.
Synthetic Datasets: Test and validate community detection methods using synthetically generated datasets.
